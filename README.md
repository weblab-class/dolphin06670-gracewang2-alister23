# Alignment Charts

A website where users can create alignment charts from scratch with varied axis scales, varied axis labels, and even multiple dimensions, where points in the charts can be either text or images. Users can plot points and generate fun charts, e.g. a plot that has one axis from "goth" to "pastel" and the other from "pizza" to "taco". In addition, users can add collaborators to their charts, branch off of others' charts to create their own variations, and "like" other users' charts. We also want to include a library of most popular charts, ranked by which charts are most-liked.
